# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Getting a Shareable URL (Deployment)

This project is configured to work with Firebase App Hosting, which makes it easy to get a live, shareable URL for your web app.

### How to Deploy:

1.  **Connect to GitHub:** If you haven't already, connect your project to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a Backend in Firebase:** In the Firebase console for your project, navigate to the "App Hosting" section and create a new backend.
3.  **Link Your Repository:** Follow the on-screen instructions to link your GitHub repository to the App Hosting backend.

Once linked, Firebase App Hosting will automatically build and deploy your application every time you push a new change to your main branch. You will get a permanent URL that you can share with your client.
